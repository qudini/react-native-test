# ReactNative-code-test

__You should use `typescript` for this task;__
 
#Task 
 
Develop a cross platform react native application that will fetch a list of customers from an API and display them on screen as detailed below. 
The API is: https://app.qudini.com/api/queue/gj9fs

The Username and password for the API are: 
- Username: codetest1
- Password: codetest100

The API will need to be authenticated against using HTTP Basic auth and will return a JSON object that contains some queue data containing a list of customer objects. 

# Requirements: 

-  The app should make a request to this api and display the list of customers (`name` and `expectedTime`), ordered by _earliest_ `expectedTime`.
-  It should also fetch the profile image of the customer by using the Gravatar Image request api (use their email for this, or show a placeholder if no email is present): https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/.
-  The app should have a text input present at the top of the list and allow customers to be filtered by customer name.
-  The app should ensure that the list reloads automatically every 30 seconds. 
-  The app is expected to use some form of state management (preferably Redux).

# Bonus:
- Some level of test coverage (using React Testing Library or Jest)
- Use of Types (using Typescript ideally)

# Extra bonus:
- Cached profile images locally


The completed project should be shared via a public github repo.

Youâ€™re free to use any 3rd part library or framework if you can justify the need.
