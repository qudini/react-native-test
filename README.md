# Front-end Engineer React / React Native Exercise

# Preface
At Qudini we utilise a range of front-end technologies which make up our stack. We're evolving our existing and greenfield applications to make use of a more modern set of technologies. We make use of React on both the web with React-DOM and on mobile devices using React-Native.

This exercise is intended to give you freedom to build an application from scratch and showcase your capabilities.
 
# Tasks
Develop a cross platform React Native application that will display a real time list of customers currently in the Queue waiting to be served.

The API to fetch the list of customers is: https://app.qudini.com/api/queue/gj9fs

Before making the API request you will need to authenticate it using HTTP `Basic Auth`. 

The Username and Password to use the API are: 
- Username: codetest1
- Password: codetest100

After making the GET request you'll receive a JSON object that contains information about the given Queue and contatin list of Customer objects.

Youâ€™re free to use any 3rd part library or framework if you can justify the need.

# Requirements
-  The app should make a request to this API and display the list of customers (`name` and `expectedTime`), ordered by _earliest_ `expectedTime`.
-  The app should fidplsy the profile image of the customer by using the `Gravatar` Image request api (using their email for this, if no email provided show a placeholder): https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/.
-  The app should have a text input present at the top of the list and allow customers to be filtered by customer name.
-  The app should ensure that the list reloads automatically every 30 seconds. 
-  The app is expected to use some form of state management (preferably `Redux`).

# Bonus
- Some level of test coverage (using `React Testing Library` or `Jest`)
- Use of Types (using `Typescript` ideally)

# Extra bonus
- Cached profile images locally


# How to subimit?
The completed project should be shared via a public `Github` repo.
